# 02 — Cannabis Display Best Practices by Category

Research-backed guidelines for how each category should be displayed on the advertising screen.

---

## General Principles (All Categories)

- **Prioritize compliance**: Display THC/CBD levels, strain type, and required warnings clearly
- **Real-time accuracy**: Products showing up on screen should be in stock — use Firestore sync to remove sold-out items instantly
- **Education sells**: Brief strain/product descriptors dramatically increase purchase confidence
- **Premium aesthetic**: Cannabis consumers (especially exotic flower buyers) respond to luxury cues — dark backgrounds, gold/emerald accents, high-quality product photography
- **Category identity**: Each category page should have a **distinct visual personality** while remaining cohesive with the brand

## 🌿 Exotic Flowers

### What Customers Want to Know
- Strain name (required, prominent)
- Indica / Sativa / Hybrid
- THC % and CBD %
- Terpene highlights (top 2-3: e.g., "Myrcene · Limonene · Caryophyllene")
- Lineage/genetics (e.g., "Gelato × OG Kush")
- Aroma/effect notes (e.g., "Earthy · Sweet · Euphoric")
- Price per gram and by weight options (1g, 3.5g, 7g, 14g, 28g)
- Rating (if available)

### Display Best Practices
- **Macro photography** of the actual buds — trichomes visible, vivid green/purple hues
- **Sensory language** in descriptors — use words that evoke smell, texture, and effect
- **Prominently show THC %** — exotic flower buyers often sort by potency
- Highlight "limited quantity" or "just dropped" badges for new or limited strains
- Use **organic, flowing shapes** for cards — circular or irregular polygon cards feel more cannabis-native than rigid rectangles
- **Color coding by type**: Green haze for Sativa, deep purple/indigo for Indica, amber for Hybrid

### Screen Layout Recommendation
- 3–8 products per screen
- Large hero card for featured/top strain (takes 40% of screen)
- Remaining strains in orbiting satellite or asymmetric grid arrangement
- Animated particle effects: floating trichome sparkles around each card

## 🍫 Edibles

### What Customers Want to Know
- Product name and brand
- Total THC mg and per-serving mg
- Flavor / ingredients highlight
- Type (gummy, chocolate, beverage, capsule, etc.)
- Onset time (e.g., "30–90 min onset")
- Effect profile (Relaxing / Energizing / Sleep / Pain)
- Price

### Display Best Practices
- **Lifestyle imagery** works better than product-only shots — show colorful gummies in a bowl, artisan chocolate bars unwrapped
- **Dosing info should be unmissable** — mg per piece and total mg must always be visible
- Use **food-inspired color palettes**: warm yellows, reds, oranges, pinks — appetite-stimulating
- Group by type (gummies vs chocolate vs beverages) within the edibles slide if many products exist
- Emphasize "low dose / beginner friendly" vs "potent" with a simple visual badge

### Screen Layout Recommendation
- 4–10 products per screen
- Fun, playful layout — products in colorful bubbles or tiered shelves
- Cards are rounded (pill-shaped or circular), not rectangular
- Animated: cards gently "bounce" as if the gummies are soft and chewy
- Background: gradient from deep purple to rich burgundy

## 💨 Disposables & Vapes

### What Customers Want to Know
- Brand and product line name
- Strain/flavor
- THC % or mg
- Battery capacity (mAh) and extract type (Live Resin, Distillate, HTFSE, etc.)
- Quantity (puff count or mg fill)
- Compatible voltage/temperature
- Price

### Display Best Practices
- **Sleek, tech-forward design** — vapes are modern lifestyle products
- High-gloss product shots on dark/black backgrounds — emphasize the device's form factor
- Use **neon/electric color schemes**: electric blue, violet, cyan
- Category identity: futuristic, premium, gadget-like
- Highlight **Live Resin** or **full-spectrum** as premium differentiators
- "Top shelf" vs "value" visual distinction

### Screen Layout Recommendation
- 4–12 products per screen
- Vertical product cards — echoing the elongated shape of vape pens
- Cards arranged in a dynamic staggered diagonal or fan-out layout
- Animated: cards slowly rotate 3D on their Y-axis showing front and back
- Background: deep space black with electric purple/blue particle field

## 🛢️ Cartridges

### What Customers Want to Know
- Brand and cartridge line name
- Strain/flavor
- Extract type (Distillate, Live Resin, Rosin, HTFSE, Terp Sauce)
- THC % or mg fill (0.5g / 1g)
- Compatibility (510-thread standard or proprietary)
- Price

### Display Best Practices
- Very similar to vapes in aesthetic, but differentiate by emphasizing extract quality
- **Extract type is the key differentiator** — make it large and prominent
- Use color to indicate quality tier: gold for Live Resin/Rosin, silver for Distillate
- Include battery compatibility note (especially if store also sells compatible batteries)
- Cross-sell opportunity: "Pair with [Battery Brand]"

### Screen Layout Recommendation
- 4–15 products per screen (cartridges come in many varieties)
- Compact cards but with bold extract type labels
- Horizontal shelf-style layout with depth perspective
- Animated: cards fan open from a deck like playing cards
- Background: metallic gradient (dark gunmetal to matte black)

## 🚬 Pre-rolls

### What Customers Want to Know
- Strain name (or blend)
- Indica / Sativa / Hybrid
- THC % (and total THC mg)
- Size (0.5g, 0.75g, 1g, 2g)
- Single or multi-pack (how many in a pack, price per unit vs pack)
- Infused? (kief, oil, concentrates, diamonds)
- Brand or house-rolled
- Effect descriptor and flavor notes

### Display Best Practices
- **Infused pre-rolls deserve premium placement** — separate from standard rolls
- Photography: pre-rolls look great in a fan-out arrangement showing multiple
- Emphasize "infused" with a fire/flame/star icon badge — it's a powerful upsell
- Multi-packs: show the value calculation ("$XX for 5 = $X each")
- Strain info for pre-rolls should mirror flower card info since they are strain-specific

### Screen Layout Recommendation
- 4–12 products per screen
- Products displayed at a slight diagonal angle (like a real pre-roll)
- "Infused" products get a glowing border or special badge
- Animated: pre-rolls fan out from a cone shape at screen center
- Background: rich amber/tobacco brown with smoke-like particle wisps

## 🔥 Deals Page

### What Customers Want to Know
- The deal name / headline (huge, unmissable)
- Original price and sale price (strikethrough + new price in bold)
- Product(s) included in the deal
- Time limit: "Today Only," "This Week," specific end date/time
- Deal type (BOGO, Bundle, Flash Sale, Loyalty Reward, First-Time Customer Discount)
- Savings amount or percentage

### Display Best Practices
- **Urgency is everything** — countdown timers, "limited quantity," "today only" language
- Use **high contrast** — bright red "SALE" badges, bright yellow/gold price callouts
- **Large, readable typography** — prices must be legible from across a room
- Make the savings obvious: show "$40 → $28" AND "Save $12 (30% off)"
- Deals rotate in a scroll/ticker if there are many deals active simultaneously
- Include the product image even on deal cards — visual recognition drives impulse buys

### Screen Layout Recommendation
- 1–6 deals displayed simultaneously
- Featured deal takes 50% of screen (hero card), remaining in side panel
- Countdown timer for time-limited deals (animated, ticking)
- Background: explosive — deep red/orange gradient, bolt/lightning motifs
- Animated: deal cards "slam" onto screen, shake slightly, then settle
- Animated price tags that "pop" in with a spring animation

## 📏 Product Card Information Hierarchy

Regardless of category, every product card on the display should follow this visual hierarchy:

```
1. Product Image          ← Largest element, top area
2. Product Name           ← Bold, very readable from distance
3. Key Stat (THC%, mg)    ← Second most prominent
4. Price                  ← 3rd most prominent, always visible
5. Secondary Info         ← Strain type, flavor, size
6. Tertiary Info          ← Terpenes, lineage, compatibility
```

Items 1-4 must always be readable from **10+ feet away** at the display resolution.
