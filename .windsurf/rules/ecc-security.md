# Security Guidelines (ECC)

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Common Vulnerability Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Severity | Fix |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Hardcoded secrets | CRITICAL | Use `process.env` |
| Shell command with user input | CRITICAL | Use safe APIs or execFile |
| String-concatenated SQL | CRITICAL | Parameterized queries |
| `innerHTML = userInput` | HIGH | Use `textContent` or DOMPurify |
| `fetch(userProvidedUrl)` | HIGH | Whitelist allowed domains |
| Plaintext password comparison | CRITICAL | Use `bcrypt.compare()` |
| No auth check on route | CRITICAL | Add authentication middleware |
| No rate limiting | HIGH | Add rate-limiting middleware |
| Logging passwords/secrets | MEDIUM | Sanitize log output |

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Apply security-reviewer persona (see ecc-agent-security-reviewer rule)
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues
